 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of E:\React practices\New folder\New folder\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * E:\React practices\New folder\New folder\JBBC-heroUi-FullStack\package-lock.json

(node:23452) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///E:/React%20practices/New%20folder/New%20folder/JBBC-heroUi-FullStack/tailwind.config.js?id=1768102243325 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to E:\React practices\New folder\New folder\JBBC-heroUi-FullStack\package.json.
